The horse raced past the barn fell .
The old man the boat .
The florist sent the flowers was pleased .
The cotton clothing is made of grows in Mississippi .
The sour drink from the ocean .
Have the students who failed the exam take the supplementary .
We painted the wall with cracks .
The man who hunts ducks out on weekends .
The raft floated down the river sank .
When Fred eats food gets thrown .
Mary gave the child the dog bit a Band-Aid .
The girl told the story cried.
I convinced her children are noisy .
Helen is expecting tomorrow to be a bad day .
Fat people eat accumulates .
I know the words to that song about the queen do nâ€™t rhyme .
She told me a little white lie will come back to haunt me .
The dog that I had really loved bones.
That Jill is never here hurts .
The man who whistles tunes pianos .
